# /hfx:plan — grill and draft a plan

User request: `$ARGUMENTS`

You are the **planner** (the main session) acting as the central planner.
Your job in this skill is to reach sync with the user, draft plan files,
and gate them through two approvals.

## Step 0 — pre-flight

```!
ls "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.harness/planner-policy.md" 2>/dev/null && echo "READY" || echo "MISSING"
```

If `MISSING`:
> `.harness/` is not initialized. Run `/hfx:init` first.

Then stop.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:
> `/hfx:plan` needs a request. Example: `/hfx:plan "Add a /health endpoint"`.

Then stop.

## Step 1 — load context

In one block of `Read` calls (parallel):
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.harness/planner-policy.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.harness/refs.yaml`
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.harness/memory/INDEX.md`

Then parse `refs.yaml`:
- Read every `always:` path.
- For each `conditional:` entry, lowercase-match its `keywords` against
  the lowercased `$ARGUMENTS`. If any keyword matches, `Read` the path.
- `manual:` entries are loaded only if the user named them in `$ARGUMENTS`
  (e.g., includes `[refs:docs/security.md]`).

If any referenced path is missing, note it but do not abort.

## Step 2 — listed installed workers

```!
ls "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\.md$//'
```

Remember the list — these are the runtime workers (Claude Code's
project-level subagents). The dispatch graph can only reference names
that appear here. Note `code-analyst` may also appear; treat it as a
helper, not a worker — never put it in `dispatch_graph`.

## Step 3 — initial intake (no questions yet)

Re-read `$ARGUMENTS` and decide which decision tier the request lives at
(planner-policy §1):
- If the request is unambiguous and the work is small: skim it to one
  candidate plan, then jump to Step 5 (propose, do not grill).
- If anything is unclear, large, or scope-ambiguous: begin grilling in
  Step 4.

State your read aloud in 2–4 sentences: "Here's what I think you want,
here's what's unclear." Then ask the user to confirm before drilling in.

## Step 4 — grilling loop

Walk down the decision tree, **one** `AskUserQuestion` at a time. Apply
planner-policy §1 (Mechanical / Taste / User Challenge).

Between questions:
- If a question would be answered by reading code, **read the code**
  instead of asking.
- If reading would flood your context (you'd open more than ~5 files):
  ```
  Agent(
    subagent_type="code-analyst",
    description="<one-line scope>",
    prompt="<a single specific question + scope hint>"
  )
  ```
  Use the bare name — `/hfx:init` installs code-analyst at
  `.claude/agents/code-analyst.md`, not under the plugin namespace.
  Use the returned summary; do not re-read.
- For external library/API docs: use `WebFetch` / `WebSearch` directly.

Stop grilling when:
- All Tier-3 (User Challenge) decisions are made.
- All Tier-2 (Taste) decisions are made or the user has explicitly
  deferred them to you.
- Tier-1 (Mechanical) decisions you handle silently are listed in your
  draft.

## Step 5 — sync gate

State the plan in conversational prose (no file yet):

```
SYNC

Goal: <one-line, verifiable>
Workers: <list, e.g., backend, docupdater>
Dispatch: <which run in parallel, which are sequential>
Out of scope: <bullet list>
Verification: <bullet list of checkable items>
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` (single):

| header | question                       | options |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------|
| Sync   | 이 sync 그대로 진행할까요?      | [a] approve — write plan files (Recommended) / [e] edit sync / [q] I have a question / [r] reject and discard |

- `[a]` → Step 6.
- `[e]` → return to Step 4, ask for the specific refinement.
- `[q]` → answer the user's question, then re-show the sync block.
- `[r]` → no plan files created yet, just print:
  > Ticket discarded before creation. Run `/compact` to clear this
  > planning context, then `/hfx:plan` again.

## Step 6 — draft plan files

Generate `ticket_id` as `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<kebab-slug-of-title>`. Use today's
date in the user's local zone if known; otherwise UTC. Slug ≤ 40 chars.

Set `TICKET_DIR = ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.harness/tickets/active/<ticket-id>`,
substituting the actual generated ticket-id.

Use the `Bash` tool to create the directory, substituting the actual
ticket-id you generated above:

    mkdir -p "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.harness/tickets/active/<actual-ticket-id-here>"

(Do NOT use a ` ```! ` shell-injection block for this step — the
ticket-id is dynamic and a literal `<ticket-id>` placeholder would be
sent to the shell unchanged.)

`Read` the two templates:
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/plan.md.tmpl`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/plan.worker.md.tmpl`

For each `__PLACEHOLDER__`, substitute. Build the `dispatch_graph.steps:`
list from the sync (one entry per worker that has actual work).

`Write`:
- `<TICKET_DIR>/plan.md` (frontmatter: `status: draft`,
  `approved_at: null`, `content_sha: null`)
- `<TICKET_DIR>/plan.<worker>.md` for every worker in the graph.

Print a tree of what was written.

## Step 7 — plan gate

Show the user the rendered file paths and the **full text** of `plan.md`
(and a one-line per `plan.<worker>.md` summary). Use `AskUserQuestion`:

| header | question                                  | options |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| Plan   | Plan 파일들 그대로 승인할까요?              | [a] approve — fill approved_at + content_sha (Recommended) / [e] edit plan files / [q] I have a question |

- `[a]` →
   1. Use the `Bash` tool (do NOT use a ` ```! ` injection block —
      the ticket-id is dynamic) to compute the sha, substituting the
      actual ticket-id you generated in Step 6:

          bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/compute-sha.sh" \
               "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.harness/tickets/active/<actual-ticket-id-here>"

      The script prints a 64-char hex digest on stdout. Capture it.
   2. `Edit` `<TICKET_DIR>/plan.md` frontmatter:
      - `status: ready`
      - `approved_at: <current ISO timestamp>`
      - `content_sha: <sha from step 1>`
   3. Print:
      > Approved. Next: `/hfx:run <actual-ticket-id>`.
- `[e]` → ask which file/section. Use `Edit` to update. Then loop back
  to Step 7 (sha will be recomputed on the next [a]).
- `[q]` → answer, then re-present Step 7.

## Step 8 — handoff

Final message must include:

```
## Ticket created
- id:     <ticket-id>
- status: ready
- files:
  - .harness/tickets/active/<ticket-id>/plan.md
  - .harness/tickets/active/<ticket-id>/plan.<worker>.md  (× N)

## Next
Run `/hfx:run <ticket-id>` to dispatch workers.
```

## Hard rules

- **Never** generate `content_sha` by guessing — only the
  `compute-sha.sh` script's output is acceptable.
- **Never** set `approved_at` without the user explicitly choosing `[a]`
  at the Step-7 gate.
- **Never** dispatch a worker from this skill — that is `/hfx:run`'s job.
- **Never** modify files outside `<TICKET_DIR>` and (with user consent)
  `.harness/memory/*` after Step 8 ends.
- Plan files must reference only installed workers (Step 2). If the sync
  needs a worker that is not installed, stop and tell the user to install
  it via `/hfx:init` (or copy the file from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/workers/`).
